# Intro

I am currently a last year PhD candidate at [ULB Center for Diabetes Research](https://www.ucdr.be) under the
supervision of [Prof Miriam Cnop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Cnop). 

&nbsp;

I graduated in 2020 with my medical degree from The Second Xiangya Hospital,[Central South University](https://dmkeylab.csu.edu.cn/),
where I was advised by [Prof Zhiguang Zhou (周智广)](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/zhouzhiguang/en/index.htm).
Though being trained as a physician, however, my medical education has cultivated my keen interest in basic research of 
disease mechanisms.

&nbsp;

Leveraging clinical and omics resources, my current work utilizes iPSC-derived islets to understand disease mechanisms 
in a patient-specific model that replicates β cell phenotype seen in individuals with SNP-associated and monogenic diabetes.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, I've been very lucky to be able to actively participate and been extensively exposed to 
both bioinformatics and phylogenetics studies during the past years. 

&nbsp;

In this regard, I am cultivating an interest toward a genomics-driven understanding of disease development, 
hoping to generate some evolutionary insights.

These experience fostered my interest in the following areas, toward which I would like to pursuit in my future.

1) `Product Development and/or Translational Studies` Through which exciting discoveries from benches return to 
bedside as well as daily life.

2) `Bioinformatics and/or Phylogenetics Studies` From which how certain pathways, cellular compartments, cells, and organs
has been evolved to sustain modern species could be inferred.

# I Like

- Rope Climbing and/or Bouldering (Highest priority: safe and soft descending.)
- Hiking (Lite version.)
- Fossil hunting (Usually find Belemnoidea instead of Ammonoidea.)
- Star gazing (I've seen the most beautiful Venus.)
- Procreate (I know how to draw an Ichthyosauria.)
- Podcasts: [凡事不烦](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/6352561c87d7f51ee0168042), [天才捕手FM](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/5e77133b418a84a0469fc305), [博物志](https://bowuzhi.fm/), among others.
- Series: [Person of Interest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/) beyonds everything.
- Things that I am ignorant about.

# Extras

- My stage/cafeteria name is "Bagel", but that hardly work in Brussels, so I adopted "Iris".
- This website is an extended version of my CV, so you need to read more.
